# Decentralized Social Network

This project is a fully decentralized social network built on the Ethereum blockchain. It leverages blockchain's unique benefits, such as portable accounts and user-driven interaction, to create a platform free from the constraints of centralized systems.

## Purpose

The project demonstrates how to build a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to connect their digital wallets, log in without back-end systems, verify their identity, and interact with other users. The platform also enables tipping functionality using Ethereum, promoting a community-driven reward system.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized User Accounts**: Users log in with their Ethereum wallets, eliminating the need for traditional account systems.
- **Identity Verification**: Ensures users are who they claim to be using wallet signatures.
- **Tipping Functionality**: Community members can send Ethereum tips to each other's posts or comments directly.
- **Portability**: User accounts are portable across platforms, removing lock-in to any specific service.
- **No Back-End Dependency**: All authentication and interactions are handled via blockchain, reducing reliance on centralized infrastructure.

## Why Decentralized?

One of the under-appreciated and under-hyped benefits of building on Ethereum is account portability. Unlike traditional systems where user accounts are tied to a platform, blockchain wallets can be taken across applications, empowering users and removing dependence on big companies.

## How It Works

1. **Wallet Connection**: Users connect their Ethereum wallets to log in.  
2. **Interaction**: Once logged in, users can post, comment, and interact with others.  
3. **Tipping**: Users can reward content creators with Ethereum tips directly from their wallets.  
4. **Identity Verification**: Wallet signatures confirm the authenticity of user actions.  

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Front-end framework for building a modular and interactive user interface.  
- **Ethereum**: Blockchain for decentralized account management and tipping.  
- **Ethers.js**: Library for blockchain interaction, including wallet connection and Ethereum transactions.  
- **CSS/HTML**: For styling and structuring the user interface.
- **Blockchain Integration:** Ethereum, MetaMask, Web3.js
- **Testing and Development:** Ganache
- **Development Tools:** VS Code, Git, GitHub
- **Deployment:** Vercel
